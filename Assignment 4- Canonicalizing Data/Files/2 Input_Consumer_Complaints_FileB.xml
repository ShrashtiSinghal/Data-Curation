        <consumerNarrative>Was a happy &redaction; card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 &redaction; converted
            the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( &redaction; ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we
            started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every
            month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire
            average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from
            previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been
            {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5
            % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the
            purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. I feel this
            practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from &redaction;
            to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous
            years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they
            have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.</consumerNarrative>

        <consumerNarrative>Checked my credit report after filing complaint with CFPB on &redaction;. Was
            finally able to get access to the dispute forms and the &redaction; &redaction; account scheduled for
            deletion XX/XX/XXXX2017 was still on record. After already registering with my report
            number, name and social security and placing the dispute in the " dispute cart '', when
            I attempted to upload as instructed, I was taken to another form which requested the
            same ( and more ) information which was already a matter of record in order to get
            access to the report in the first place. Screenshots attached. Designed to
            discourage?</consumerNarrative>

        <issue><issueType>Deposits and withdrawals</issueType></issue>
        <consumerNarrative>I deposited what turned out to be a fraudulent check drawn on Wells Fargo
            by mobile deposit to my savings account at Wells Fargo on &redaction; at &redaction; &redaction; Time for
            {$2400.00}. They gave me full availability of the {$2400.00} on &redaction; at which time I
            withdrew {$2200.00} and the bank then returned the deposited check on &redaction; creating an
            overdraft in my account of over {$2000.00}. Wells Fargo rep explained that they do not
            process mobile deposits until late the night one day after the deposit was made. This
            means they honored the withdrawal request before they processed the transaction. That
            gave me the false assurance that the deposited check was good. The cash is gone to the
            perpetrator and now they want me to cover the overdraft. The fact they wait a whole
            business day before processing these deposits is for their convenience and the consumer
            should not be held accountable for the consequences of this delay. Also UCC 4-301 ( b )
            addresses the final payment of on-us checks deposited and states that the payor bank has
            until midnight of the next banking day to decide whether to honor the check. If they do
            n't act by midnight deadline, they lose the right to dishonor the check. 4-214 ( c ),
            4-301 ( b ). The mobile deposit confirmation states " The following mobile deposit was
            made on &redaction; at &redaction; Time '' and her account statement shows the deposit under the
            posting date of &redaction;. Therefore, applying UCC 4-214 ( c ), the deposited check drawn on
            Wells Fargo should have been returned and charged back under the posting date of &redaction;.
            It was not. The chargeback is posted under processing date of &redaction;.</consumerNarrative>
